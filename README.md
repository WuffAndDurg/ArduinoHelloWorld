# ArduinoHelloWorld
*A first little example repo to get Wuff started :>*

Henlo cutie!
I thought about how to introduce you into C++ coding in a nice and easy way, without boring you to death.
So I've decided to make this repo to share with you, prepare little exercises and hints, and go through different stages of the whole thing!

I'll make sure to give every "lesson" a good README that'll explain what I intend to show you, present you with a problem that you can try solving yourself by going through the AVR docs (which I am sure you will want to try >.<), and give you an appropriate explanation of what's going on!

We'll start off easy and use an Arduino and the Arduino IDE, but that won't stop us from using the exact same C++ code that will be compiled with other tools such as a Makefile or Eclipse or AVR Studio, so you're not missing out!

You want to start off?
Good! Hop into the `lessons` folder and I'll (hopefully, eventually) prepare things for you there <.<
