# Git - A tool you better love >:c
Or: Why durg will bap you softly if you don't use git >>:C

### What is git, exactly?
Well ... Alright, you probably already know that, but I just want to give you the short explanation because why now <.<

Git is a content versioning system, meaning it keeps track of all the silly stuff you do with the code, and makes sure that I can revert anything you break (:P).
It also allows you to "try out" changes in branches, without affecting other people's work, and then safely combining your and your friends' work later on! :>

There *are* other tools out there, sure, but almost all of them work in a similar fasion, and git has become the Open Source community's standard, in a way :>

### What do I need to know?
Don't worry, not much! I don't expect you to do much fancy stuff, except poke words into the console.
You *could* even use the `Atom` editor, which has a really neato Git interface, but ... That's boring, isn't it? :P

All I want you to be able to do is:
- `git add`
	- This will add a file for your next commit, be it a new or already known one.
- `git commit`
	- Preeeeety self-explanatory, I hope >.>
- `git pull`
	- This will update your own repository from GitHub, so that if I do notice a typo or that I did something weirdly, I can fix it >.>
- `git push`
	- And finally, this will put all your *commited* changes onto GitHub! (Any files you didn't `add` and then `commit` will be left alone!)

We can get into more details of git later, but really, you will mostly only ever need these here :>

### In this lection
I want to get you moving with these basics for git and GitHub
That way, you'll know what to do to keep me updated!

**You will:**
- Clone the repo here
- Make a few tweaks to some files
- Push them to a new branch and finally
- Open a PR to tell me that I messed up :>
