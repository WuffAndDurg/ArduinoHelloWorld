## Cloning the repo

The first thing you'll have to do before you can really do anything with this repository is
to *clone* it.\
Cloning means that you create a local copy of the code on GitHub, and tell your PC to upload
code here :>

Luckily, the process for all of that is pretty easy:
- Go to the front page of the repository.
 There should be a big green button on the right, saying `Clone or Download`
- Click on it! There should now be a window there that says something similar to `Clone with HTTPS`  
If it says `Clone with SSH`, you might have to press the small `Use HTTPS instead` link.
- Copy that link!
- Make a folder somewhere you're comfy with. Don't put it near the trash bin - Mesh might eat it up!
- Open a terminal, `cd` into the folder, then type `git clone ` and paste the link in. After you press enter, everything should be downloaded!

And you're done! Goood boyo <3  
You can look through the files if you want, but don't change anything yet!
We'll get to that :D
